        """
        Generate a 2D Voronoi diagram for the specified point coordinates.

        In 2D, Voronoi analysis identifies a polygonal neighborhood about each
        input coordinate that includes all coordinates closer to that input
        coordinate than to any other input coordinate. Consequently, coordinates
        along the boundary of a neighborhood are equidistant from two input
        coordinates, and the vertices of the polygonal neighborhoods are
        equidistant from three (or more) input coordinates. As a simple example,
        the Voronoi diagram for a grid of equally spaced points is a grid of
        squares, with each square centered on one of the input points.

        coords is an array of shape (-1, 2) or a MultiPoint2D that specifies the
        point coordinates for which the Voronoi diagram should be generated. If
        coords is a MultiPoint2D for which a .spatial_reference is assigned, the
        results will also have that .spatial_reference.

        merge_option is a string that specifies the behavior when two or more
        input coordinates are so close that they must be merged. If
        merge_option is "IGNORE", no action is triggered by such merging. If
        merge_option is instead "ERROR", an error is raised in the event of such
        merging.

        translate is a string that specifies how coords, or a copy thereof,
        should be translated prior to Voronoi analysis. Translation to lower
        magnitude values (i.e., to a position near the origin) improves
        precision and can avoid merging. The following options are supported
        (where each code snippet assumes coords is an array):
            None:
                Do not translate.
            "FIRST":
                Translate the copy of coords so that the first coordinate
                (coords_copy[0]) is at (0, 0).
            "MEAN":
                Translate the copy of coords so that the mean coordinate
                (coords_copy.mean(0)) is at (0, 0).
            "MEDIAN":
                Translate the copy of coords so that the median coordinate
                (numpy.percentile(coords_copy, 50., 0)) is at (0, 0).
            "MIN":
                Translate the copy of coords so that the minimum coordinate
                (coords_copy.min(0)) is at (0, 0).
        In addition, "_NO_COPY" may be appended to any of the above options to
        avoid copying coords prior to translation. In that case, coords is
        translated approximately back to its original values before the function
        returns. The similarity of these restored values to their original
        counterparts depends on the vagaries of floating point arithmetic. More
        generally, if any translation is applied (i.e., translate is not None),
        the results for the translated (copy of) coords are similarly translated
        back before the function returns.

        localize is a boolean that specifies whether four carefully chosen
        coordinates should be added to those specified by coords. In the Voronoi
        diagram, the most exterior points in coords have infinite neighborhoods,
        because no matter how far one goes out, one finds a coordinate closer to
        one of those exterior points than to any other point in coords. If
        localize is True, the four points added to the diagram are each the most
        exterior in that direction, and therefore ensure that the most exterior
        *finite* neighborhood boundaries circumscribe the original coords,
        thereby localizing the Voronoi diagram. Regardless of whether "_NO_COPY"
        is appended to the translate argument, these points are never added in
        places to coords.

        See scipy.spatial.Voronoi for documentation of the furthest_site and
        qhull_options arguments.

        Note: Specifying "Q7" for qhull_options may improve performance.

        Initiate skeleton derivation for a polygon. (Compare EasySkeleton.)

        In simplest terms, the skeleton of a polygon collapses an elongate
        polygon to a linear form. For example, the outline of a river is a
        polygon (with a nonzero area). However, we often think of a river in
        terms of its skeleton, such as when a river is drawn as a line on a map.
        Even though that line does not represent the river's width, it still
        captures a useful expression of the river's geometry. The specific
        algorithm implemented by the current class has a lot of moving parts,
        but in effect, these are the highlights:
            1) Sample points along the boundary of polygon, including around any
               holes.
            2) Compute a Voronoi diagram. (See Voronoi2D.)
            3) Isolate the "graph skeleton" from the other extraneous bits
               (which together make up the graph skeleton's "complement") in the
               Voronoi diagram. (For example, each hole in polygon has its own
               skeleton that should be discarded.)
            4) "Partition out" paths from the graph skeleton to incrementally
               construct the "partitioned skeleton". (See
               .partition_out_trunk().)
            5) Optionally add "tails" to the paths so that they extend to
               polygon's boundary. (See .add_tails().)
            6) Optionally prune away undesired paths. (See .prune().)
        At initialization (i.e., when the current function is called), the above
        steps are executed partway through step 3 (but see note further below).
        The curious should consider reading the following paper for a more
        detailed, albeit technical, description of the algorithm, including some
        very helpful figures:
            Schaefer, E. I., & Pelletier, J.D. (in review). An algorithm to 
            reduce a river network or other graph-like polygon to a set of 
            lines. Computers & Geosciences.

        polygon is a Polygon for which skeleton derivation will be executed.

        interval is a float that specifies the interval along polygon's boundary
        at which coordinates are sampled, in map units. Its effect is similar to
        a resolution: finer (smaller) values yield results with finer precision
        but also entail higher memory footprints. Ideally, interval should be no
        coarser than half the width of polygon's narrowest constriction. (See
        "CUT" isolation_mode option.) If interval is specified as 0, an
        approximately "optimized" interval is set automatically (but see note
        further below).

        isolation_mode is a string that specifies several aspects of how the
        graph skeleton is isolated from its complement and general memory
        safeguards. The available options, which may be combined as long as they
        are delimited by underscores, are:
            "NAIVE"
                If polygon and its complement (i.e., the holes in polygon and
                the area surrounding polygon) everywhere have a width equal to
                at least twice interval, the skeleton can be more efficiently
                isolated by assuming that 1) only the skeleton lies within
                polygon and 2) the skeleton is completely contained within
                polygon.
            "VERIFY"
                "VERIFY" is ignored unless "NAIVE" is also specified. In that
                case, (something similar to) the second assumption in "NAIVE" is
                tested and, upon failure, the algorithm resorts to non-naive
                skeleton isolation.
            "CUT"
                If interval is anywhere coarser than half the polygon's local
                width, the skeleton may not be contained to polygon (Theorem 4.1
                of Brandt and Algazi (1992)). If there is any ambiguity as to
                whether a (degree-3) hub belongs to the skeleton, it is "cut"
                along with all edges terminating at that hub. This is a
                heuristic resolution to facilitate the isolation of the skeleton
                from its complement when interval is coarser than ideal and can
                have undesired effects on the resulting skeleton. Cutting is
                only applied if not cutting would cause skeleton isolation to
                fail. If any nodes are cut, their Voronoi vertex indices are
                stored to the array .cut_vor_vert_idxs_array.
            "SAFE"
                At the two steps (2 and 4, as numbered further above) with the
                greatest memory footprints, it is tested whether continued
                processing would exhaust targ_GB. If such exhaustion is
                predicted, processing is aborted and a MemoryError is raised.
            "STORE"
                If cutting is used:
                    1) stores the array .naive_skel_vor_vert_idxs_array, which
                       records the Voronoi vertex indices of all nodes that 
                       provisionally were interpreted to belong to the skeleton 
                       prior to cutting; all nodes ultimately interpreted to 
                       belong to the skeleton form a strict subset of those 
                       nodes
                    2) optimizes .test_poly_contains_node()
                Otherwise:
                    .naive_skel_vor_vert_idxs_array is None.
                
        Remaining arguments are documented with EasySkeleton.__init__().

        Note: Although it can be very useful to specify a zero interval or
        template_interval, there are some important factors to bear in mind:
            1) If you do not specify targ_GB, the "optimized" interval will
               depend on the memory currently available on your computer at that
               specific time. That available memory does *not* include any
               memory currently claimed by Python that is, in fact, available
               for reuse, and therefore can be significantly underestimated.
               Consuming additional memory during processing (e.g., by opening
               other programs) could also cause the algorithm to fail and/or
               slow your computer.
            2) You should always describe your results in terms of the interval
               value that is ultimately used, possibly after optimization
               (.interval), and, if applicable, the corresponding template
               interval's value (.template_interval). Doing so ensures that (1)
               your results can be easily reproduced without the optimization
               process, by directly specifying those values, and (2) that any
               such reproduction is not dependent on the individual system
               (e.g., physical memory), system state (e.g., available memory),
               or optimization code (which may be updated in the future) used.
            3) The optimization of interval (but not template_interval) involves
               a brute-force search that can be very computationally expensive,
               especially (and perhaps counterintuitively) if polygon has a
               relatively simple geometry (e.g., shaped like a "Y" rather than a
               more complicated tree or even mesh-like shape).
            4) During the brute-first search, step 3 (as enumerated further
               above) is executed to completion rather than only partway.
            5) Some details of the brute-search for an optimized interval can be
               retrieved by .estimate_safe_interval() and .get_safe_interval().
            6) The "optimized" value is no coarser than double that interval
               that would approximately exhaust targ_GB. However, because the
               relationship between memory footprint and interval is not linear,
               the optimized interval may use much less than half of the
               targeted memory footprint.

        Return bounds on what intervals can be safely processed for a polygon.

        The current function iteratively initializes a Skeleton for the
        specified polygon and isolation_mode at each of multiple sampling
        intervals as part of a brute-force search for an "optimized" interval
        (which here means the smallest interval that can be comfortably fully
        processed within the targeted memory footprint) up to the point where
        the memory footprint ultimately required for processing can be
        estimated. A tuple with five items is returned:
            idx    Meaning
            0      That sampling interval (within a factor of 2) that can
                   approximately completely consume the targeted memory. (See
                   documentation for Skeleton.__init__().) If no such interval
                   can be identified, an error will be raised as though
                   Skeleton.__init__() were called. [float]
            1      That coarsest sampling interval that was directly tested and
                   would have consumed more memory than targeted. By definition,
                   this value is less than the value at idx=0 and represents an
                   approximate lower bound on the intervals that can be
                   successfully processed for the specified polygon and
                   isolation_mode within the targeted memory. [float]
            2      The finest sampling interval that was directly tested and for
                   which the resulting skeleton could not be isolated despite
                   cutting (see "CUT" isolation_mode option in
                   Skeleton.__init__().) May be infinity if every tested
                   skeleton could be isolated, whether by cutting or without it.
                   By definition, this value is greater than the value at idx=0
                   and represents an approximate upper bound on the intervals
                   that can be successfully processed for the specified polygon
                   and isolation_mode. [float]
            3      A boolean indicating whether cutting was required for the
                   interval at idx=0. In essence, "_CUT" is automatically
                   appended to isolation_mode prior to testing, so the boolean
                   at idx=3 may be True even if you do not specify "CUT" in
                   isolation_mode. [bool]
            4      The target memory footprint in GB. [float]

        include_partitioning is a boolean that specifies whether the memory
        required for partitioning out should be included in testing. If
        include_partitioning is False, the current function returns very quickly
        with a tuple of three items:
            idx    Meaning
            0      That sampling interval that would completely consume the
                   targeted memory. [float]
            1      The finest sampling interval that will be initially permitted
                   if the "SAFE" isolation_mode option is specified. (The
                   estimated memory footprint of partitioning is accounted for
                   later, and processing may be aborted at that time, and an
                   error raised, if the combined memory footprint for non-
                   partitioning and partitioning exceeds the targeted memory
                   footprint.)
            2      The target memory footprint in GB. [float]

        Add uninterrupted terminal loops to the partitioned skeleton.

        Other than .partition_out*()'s, the current function is the only
        function that adds paths to the partitioned skeleton. Specifically, it
        adds uninterrupted terminal loops, which are those edges (contracted
        through their binodes only) that would have been added to the graph
        skeleton except that they begin and end at the same node (which is
        initially a degree-3 hub. They can only exist if .polygon contains one
        or more holes, but even then, are typically rare and may not exist for
        most skeletons with holes as looped paths (also called "cycles") around
        holes are commonly interrupted by the terminations of other edges.
        Because such uninterrupted terminal loops create issues for later
        processing, they are quarantined as soon as they are recognized, which
        is immediately before finalization of the graph skeleton. Note that,
        after this quarantining, the node that was the stem hub for the loop
        becomes a stub (hence why such loops are called "terminal"). Somewhat
        analogous to .partition_out*()'s, the current function:
            1) Iterates over each uninterrupted terminal loop whose stem is
               present in the partitioned skeleton.
            2) Removes (accepted) uninterrupted terminal loops from their
               quarantine.
            3) Adds uninterrupted terminal loops to the partitioned skeleton.
            4) Returns an integer that indicates the total number of
               uninterrupted terminal loops added to the partitioned skeleton

        test_func is a function that specifies a test function to be applied to
        each loop. It serves the same role as test_func in .partition_out_*()'s
        except that 1) only a Type 3 call is executed, with kind specified as
        "loop" (see .make_test_func() and the .make_deep_test_func() of the 
        function returned by that method), and 2) the abort value returned by 
        *_test_func() is ignored, because loops are iterated over in arbitrary 
        order. If test_func is not specified (None), every loop is considered 
        acceptable.

        Warning: After calling the current function, the deletion of paths from
        the partitioned skeleton could result in the isolation of uninterrupted
        terminal loops so that they no longer touch the rest of the partitioned
        skeleton. For this reason, it is suggested that the current function be
        called only after all path deletions have been executed.

        """
        Re-contract edges of graph skeleton through (degree 2) binodes.

        A (degree 2) "binode" exists wherever exactly two edges meet.
        Immediately prior to the start of the partitioning out, any nodes that
        are then binodes are irrelevant to the routing that underlies
        partitioning out. In essence, these binodes are like stations that a
        train passes through but at which it never stops. Because the train does
        not deviate when passing through these stations, the conductor doesn't
        require any specific knowledge of the stations. Similarly, prior to
        partitioning out, these binodes can be dropped from the graph skeleton.
        More accurately, in our train example, this would be like removing the
        pass-through stations from the train route's map but, of course,
        retaining the geometry of the links between stations at which the train
        does stop. Contracting through binodes can improve performance and (more
        significantly) decrease the memory footprint.

        Note: Edges are always contracted through binodes during initialization,
        but later processing (e.g., manual deletion of edges by .delete_lines())
        may render the graph skeleton "ripe" for another such contraction. After
        the start of partitioning out, however, any node that was a (degree 3)
        "hub" when partitiong out began may be reduced to a binode in the
        (residual) graph skeleton by the partitioning out of a path that
        terminated there. Nonetheless, these nodes remain essential to continued
        partitioning out. Therefore, calling the current function after the
        start of partitioning out will raise an error and leave the graph
        skeleton intact.

        Warning: The current function may itself be very expensive in terms of
        computation time.

        """
        Replace (degree >3) hyperhubs with loops perpendicular to the x-y plane.

        Additional nodes with duplicate (x, y) coordinates are added to the
        graph skeleton (and relevant records) to ensure that no hub has degree
        >3. In effect, this is nearly identical to projecting a loop at the hub
        upward, out of the x-y plane. At various points along this loop,
        adjacent nodes in the x-y plane are attached so that no juncture has
        more than three edges. A loop is used to ensure that no stubs are added
        to the graph skeleton. The only divergence of the actual solution from
        this mental picture is that the loop has 0 size in x, y, and z
        coordinates. adj_dict, which is updated in place, is returned.

        adj_dict is a dictionary with the same form as the adj_dict argument in
        ._contract_through_binodes().

        Note: The current function is only called if a hyperhub is detected.

        Note: The current function is designed with the thought that it could be
        overridden (e.g., in a subclass). However, one should note the
        attributes assigned by the current function and likewise assign to these
        attributes compatible data in any overriding function. (See source
        code.)
        
        Warning: If multiple edges from a single hyperhub end at the same node,
        the 0-size loop cracking strategy (described further above) fails 
        because it cannot reduce the degree of all affected nodes to <=3
        (without recursion, which is not attempted). If this case is 
        encountered, The current function raises an error. Fortunately, this
        case (though tested for) should be impossible in practice as duplicate
        edges linking the same node pair cannot occur among Voronoi segments
        and hyperhubs are cracked prior to contraction through binodes. If 
        hyperhubs were *not* cracked at that time, contraction through binodes
        could cause one or more hyperhubs to have duplicate edges linking the
        same node pair.

        """
        Contract edges of a graph through (degree 2) binodes.

        Commonly, many nodes link exactly two Voronoi segments (and therefore
        have degree 2 in a graph sense). These "binodes" are inconsequential for
        the path-finding between non-binodes executed during partitioning out.
        To minimize memory use during such path-finding (which can be
        prohibitive), the current function merges segments through binodes so
        that only (degree 1) "stubs" and (degree >=3) "hubs" remain. In graph
        theory, this process could be properly called path contraction between
        nodes whose respectives degrees are not 2. For brevity, the process is
        here termed "[path] contraction through binodes" or simply "binode
        contraction." Also from graph theory, links between nodes are called
        "edges". That term is likewise used here. Note that each edge comprises
        >=1 Voronoi segments. The current function can also be used to re-
        contract a graph skeleton's edges (which are no longer guaranteed to be
        Voronoi segments) through binodes, presumably after editing of that
        skeleton (so that the re-contraction has some effect). On each call, the
        following attributes are updated as described:
            ._graph_edge_dict                       created or re-created
            ._loop_dict                             extended
            ._vor_vert_idx_to_graph_degree_array    created or reset+repopulated

        adj_dict is a dict in which each key is an integer and each value is a
        list of integers. This "adjacency dictionary" represents a graph in
        which a node (indicated by its Voronoi index, stored as the dict key)
        can reach each of n other nodes (indicated by a list of their respective
        Voronoi indices, stored as the dict value). Beacuse this graph is
        invariably symmetric, each edge is doubly represented:
            all_indices_adjacent_to_i = adj_dict[i]
            nbr_idx = all_indices_adjacent_to_i[0]  # Arbitrary neighbor.
            all_indices_adjacent_to_nbr_idx = adj_dict[nbr_idx]
            i in all_indices_adjacent_to_nbr_idx --> True

        source_edge_dict is a dict with the same format as the edge_dict
        argument in ._make_csr_matrix(). If adj_dict was derived from an edge
        dictionary (so that the graph described by adj_dict may contain edges
        comprised of multiple Voronoi segments), that edge dictionary must be
        specified for the source_edge_dict argument to avoid erroneous results.

        Note: In addition, the current function "cracks" (degree >3)
        "hyperhubs" (via ._crack_hyperhubs()), that is, adds duplicate nodes to
        simulate the connectivity of each hyperhub but ensure that the maximum
        degree of any node is 3. The absence of hyperhubs is a fundamental
        assumption made throughout the current class.

        Partition out successively shorter full paths from the graph skeleton.

        The current function executes a search (based on the Dijkstra or, if any
        costs are negative, the Johnson algorithm) for the minimum cumulative
        cost ("shortest") paths from each specified from-node to each specified
        to-node. (Edge costs are calculated using cost_func.) It then considers
        the highest cost ("longest") of these paths, followed by successively
        lower cost (shorter) paths (unless one_path_only is True and path is
        acceptable as determined by test_func() and
        vor_vert_idxs_pool*_array's). Note that this decreasing trend is cost is
        only guaranteed for full paths; if a path converges with an earlier
        accepted path, it is truncated at that point of convergence (if truncate
        is True) and therefore may have lower cost (be shorter) than other paths
        considered thereafter. This sequence continues until all paths are
        exhausted (or, if truncate is False, until the first convergence). After
        walking each path, it registers that path to the partitioned skeleton
        under the specified kind if that path is acceptable (as determined by
        test_func() and vor_vert_idxs_pool*_array's). Finally, it returns a
        tuple of the form
            (added_path_count, cumulative_cost, includes_truncated,
             considered_full_path_count, deleted_path_count)
        where
            added_path_count:      Total number of paths partitioned out
                                   (including each truncated part, if any).
            cumulative_cost:       Total cost of all paths (including at least
                                   those full paths that were not truncated).
            includes_truncated:    Boolean (True/False) indicating whether
                                   cumulative_cost includes the cost of any
                                   truncated parts that were partitioned out.
            considered_path_count: Total number of full paths that were
                                   considered. If search was aborted, this count
                                   includes the path that was being considered
                                   when the abort was triggered.
            deleted_path_count:    Total number of paths (including each
                                   truncated part, if any) deleted from the
                                   graph skeleton. This may be greater than
                                   added_path_count if test_func()'s returned
                                   values indicating that a path should be
                                   discarded without being partitioned out.

        kind is a string that specifies the key in
        self._kind_to_partitioned_path_dict to which any accepted paths will be
        registered.

        cost_func is a function that is called to assign a cost to each edge.
        See .make_cost_func() and._make_csr_matrix() for more details.

        from_vor_vert_idxs_array is a flat array of integers (but see note
        further below) that specifies the indices of Voronoi vertices that are
        permitted to be path starts.

        to_vor_vert_idxs_array is a flat array of integers (but see note further
        below) that specifies the indices of Voronoi vertices that are permitted
        to be path ends. If to_vor_vert_idxs_array is equivalent to
        from_vor_vert_idxs_array, specifying both arguments by the same array
        will improve performance.

        test_func is a function that is called to determine whether a particular
        path should be accepted and partitioned out, merely deleted from the
        graph skeleton, or skipped, and whether path-processing should continue.
        See .make_test_func().

        vor_vert_idxs_pool1_array is a flat array of integers (but see note
        further below) that specifies the pool of Voronoi vertex indices that
        are acceptable for the start or (possibly truncated) end of a path. If
        both vor_vert_idxs_pool1_array and vor_vert_idxs_pool2_array are
        specified (not None), acceptable paths must start at a Voronoi vertex
        with its index in one of these arrays and end at a Voronoi vertex with
        its index in the other array.

        vor_vert_idxs_pool2_array is a flat array of integers (but see note
        further below) that specifies the pool of Voronoi vertex indices that
        are acceptable for the start or (possibly truncated) end of a path. If
        both vor_vert_idxs_pool1_array and vor_vert_idxs_pool2_array are
        specified (not None), acceptable paths must start at a Voronoi vertex
        with its index in one of these arrays and end at a Voronoi vertex with
        its index in the other array.

        one_path_only is a boolean that specifies whether only one path should
        be processed. If one_path_only is True and test_func is specified (not
        None), multiple paths may be considered but iteration will cease upon
        the first accepted path. (.max and .min of cost_func are still honored.)

        truncate is a boolean that specifies whether paths may be truncated
        where they converge with an earlier path accepted on the current call.
        If truncate is False, path processing is aborted when the first such
        convergence is encountered.

        forbidden_nodes_arrays is a sequence of flat arrays of Voronoi vertex
        indices whose union specifies what nodes cannot be touched by any path.
        For convenience, forbidden_nodes_arrays can also be specified by a
        single flat array.

        Note: All arguments whose names end with "array" (therefore excluding
        forbidden_nodes_arrays) can be specified by any of the following:
            1) a flat array of integers
            2) a (non-array) flat sequence of integers
            3) a string corresponding to a node kind recognized by .get_nodes()
               for the graph skeleton
        Internally, the interdependence of these arguments is leveraged to
        optimize processing. As a simple example, if from_vor_vert_idxs_array
        is a subset of vor_vert_idxs_pool1_array and vor_vert_idxs_pool2_array
        is not specified, from_vor_vert_idxs_array guarantees satisfaction of
        the vor_vert_idxs_pool1_array criterion, which therefore need never be
        tested. To maximize this optimization, you should specify equivalent
        arguments by identical objects. For example, if you specify
        from_vor_vert_idxs_array=a, it is faster to specify
        to_vor_vert_idxs_array=a instead of to_vor_vert_idxs_array=a.copy().

        Note: A path is considered unacceptable as soon as it is known that any
        specified criterion cannot be satisfied: vor_vert_idxs_pool1_array,
        vor_vert_idxs_pool2_array, or test_func. Also, the current function
        returns immediately after convergence if truncate is True (or after
        acceptance of a single path if one_path_only is True). One consequence
        is that test_func() is not guaranteed to see every considered path.

        Create scipy.sparse.csr_matrix for a graph given its edge dictionary.

        The csr matrix and a flat array are returned in a 2-tuple of the form
        (csr_matrix, reidx_to_idx_array). The flat array is populated with the
        unique Voronoi vertex indices in edge_dict and is sorted. To minimize
        the size of the csr matrix (and, more importantly, any dense arrays
        derived therefrom, such as the costs and predecessors arrays generated
        during path-finding), its row and column indices do not directly
        correspond to the original Voronoi vertex indices. However, any array
        populated with these row and column "re-indices", or the original
        Voronoi vertex indices, can be easily inter-converted:
            original_indices_array = reidx_to_idx_array[reindices_array]

        edge_dict is a dict in which each key is a _Frozenset2 of length 2 and
        each value is a LineString. The value represents the edge between the
        two Voronoi vertices whose indices populate the corresponding key, and
        the directionality of the edge is implied by the order of those indices
        in key.tuple (hence why a _Frozenset2 is used instead of a standard
        frozenset). Usually, edge_dict is self._graph_edge_dict.

        cost_func is a function that is called to populate values in the
        returned csr matrix. Specifically, cost_func(edge, key, flipped) is
        called, where edge is the LineString returned by edge_dict[key] and
        flipped is a boolean (True or False) indicating whether the edge's cost
        should be measured in reverse (that is, the edge is walked from key[1]
        to key[0]). If costs are independent of direction so that the flipped
        argument can be safely ignored, greater performance can be achieved by
        assigning
            cost_func.is_directed = False
        If cost_func is not specified, all weights are assumed to be 1.

        Warning: Conversion from original Voronoi vertex indices to reindices
        by
            reidx_to_idx_array.searchsorted(original_indices_array)
        is only guaranteed to yield correct results if original_indices_array
        exclusively contains original Voronoi vertex indices represented in
        edge_dict.keys().

        Note: The returned csr matrix will be symmetric if and only if
        cost_func() is direction-indepedent. Nonetheless, for simplicity, the
        matrix can be treated as directed regardless of the nature of
        cost_func(). This is (of course) necessary if cost_func() is direction-
        dependent, but it also "generally leads to more efficient computation"
        even if cost_func() is direction-independent (per scipy.sparse.csgraph
        documentation at scipy version 1.1.0).

        The edge or path dictionary to which the line was registered is
        returned, or None if the line was not registered.

               b) kind is a string: kind is reset to "loop".

               opportunistic partitioning out of commingled trunks and branches
               formed by truncating trunk paths.)
            3) If kind is "branch" but both the start and end nodes exist in the
               partitioned skeleton, kind is reset to "bridge". (This permits
               opportunistic partitioning out of commingled branches and bridges
               formed by truncating branch paths.)

        vor_vert_idxs is a sequence of integers that implies line's components.
        vor_vert_idxs must be specified if line's components are relevant. (See
        documentation for kind argument.)

        idx0 is an integer that specifies the start Voronoi vertex index. If
        idx0 is not specified (None), the correct integer is found
        automatically.

        idxN is an integer that specifies the end Voronoi vertex index. If idxN
        is not specified (None), the correct integer is found automatically.

        from_kind is a string that specifies the partitioned category from which
        the line or its components should be removed. See documention for kind
        argument.

        Warning: Specifying idx0, idx1, or vor_vert_idxs incorrectly will cause
        issues. These arguments are merely provided to avoid the cost of
        internal generation of the correct objects when possible.

            applies to standard attributes of LineString2D's.

        [5] Only assigned for (partitioned out) branches and loops.
        [6] This is the Voronoi vertex index of stub_coords_array if no tail
            has been added. Otherwise, it is the Voronoi vertex index of the
            stub to which that tail was added (because a tail's end is never at
            a Voronoi vertex). In other words, it is determined prior to tail
            addition and is unmmodified by tail addition.
        Except for .skeleton, all of the listed public data attributes (i.e.,
        those without a leading underscore), even .coords_array, are lazily
        generated (from .vor_vert_idxs_array). Those marked with * (**) are
        somewhat (especially) computationally expensive. .coords_array3D,
        .delta_z, and .length3D are only supported if the input polygon is 3D.

        kind is a string that specifies the category of lines to return:
            "graph"                 edges that have not yet been partitioned out
            "quarantined_loop"      uninterrupted terminal loops that have not

                                    added to the partitioned skeleton (see
                                    .add_loops_to_partitioned())
        If kind is not recognized, an empty list is returned.

        include_loops is a boolean that specifies whether uninterrupted terminal
        loops should be included. include_loops is ignored unless kind is
        "graph" or "partitioned".

        hardness_level is an integer that specifies how the returned lines
        should behave upon deletion of the current Skeleton.
            0  Pro:  Minimizes memory footprint and the time required to
                     initially generate the returned lines.
               Con:  Each returned line will be unusable once self is deleted.
            1  Pro:  Each line will permanently support all regular LineString2D
                     attributes and functionality.
               Con:  Maximies total memory footprint (i.e., that shared between
                     lines and self) and the time required to initially generate
                     the returned lines. Additionally, each line is only
                     guaranteed to support the special attributes listed above
                     (e.g., .area) if self has not been deleted or that
                     attribute was used, whether directly or indirectly.
               Note: Calling line.minimize_memory(True) will reduce a line of
                     hardness 1 to hardness 0 (but have no hardness effect if
                     line's hardness is 2). Lines are automatically elevated to
                     hardness 1 if .coords_array is used prior to the deletion
                     of self.
            2  Pro:  Each line will permanently support all regular LineString2D
                     attributes and functionality, as well as those special
                     attributes listed above (e.g., .area).
               Con:  Deleting self releases no memory (unlike all other hardness
                     levels).
               Note: No call of line.minimize_memory(...) can modify the
                     hardness of lines with this hardness.
        Strictly, hardness_level specifies the minimum permitted hardness level.
        If a line already has a higher hardness than that specified, it is not
        demoted. If hardness_level is unspecified (None), it defaults to 1 for
        partitioned paths and 0 otherwise. If you ultimately write out any of
        these lines, they will be promoted to a hardness level of 1 if they are
        only hardness level 0 at the time.

        Get node information from either the graph or partitioned skeleton.

        To describe the targeted nodes, a tuple of the form
            (indices_array, coords_array, degrees_array)
        is returned in which indices_array is a flat array whose values are each

        paths that touch it (or None). indices_array is always sorted
        (ascending), and coords_array and degrees_array are in the same order so
        that the nth value in each array describes the same node. If no nodes of
        the specified kind exist, None is returned instead of a tuple. A major
        use for the current method is to help the user specify the nodes
        argument in .partition_out*()'s.

        kind is a string that specifies the category of nodes to return:
            kind                Description
            "stub"        [1]   degree 1 nodes

            "loop2"       [3,5] "loop" + current/potential loop binodes
            "end"         [6]   nodes from either end of each edge or path
            "cut"         [7]   hubs removed by cutting
        [1] If both graph and partitioned are True, the degree of a given node
            in each skeleton is summed. For example, a node that is a stub in
            the graph skeleton and a binode in the partitioned skeleton would be
            included in get_nodes(kind="hub", graph=True, partitioned=True).
            This summation also applies to degrees_array, if generated.
        [2] Hyperhubs, with degree >3, only exist in the raw data. (See note
            further below.)
        [3] Exactly one of graph and partitioned must be specified as True, or
            an error is raised. If partitioned is True, the described nodes
            reflect the current categorization within the partitioned skeleton.
            If graph is instead True, only nodes from the graph skeleton are
            described and represent those nodes that are suitable for use in the
            specified way based on a simple local analysis of the current node
            degree in each skeleton. For example, a node that is a stub in the
            graph skeleton and a binode in the partitioned skeleton could
            potentially serve as a branch stem. However, consider a more
            ambiguous example: could a node that is currently a hub in the graph
            skeleton and absent from the partitiond skeleton likewise
            potentially serve as a branch stem? Eventually, maybe, but not
            immediately. The kinds listed above will honor the "eventually"
            interpretation. If you wish to instead impose the "immediately"
            interpretation, prepend "next_" (e.g., "next_branch_stem"). The
            following kinds are therefore equivalent aliases if graph is True:
                "branch_stub", "trunk", "next_branch_stub", and "next_trunk"
                "branch_stem" and "bridge"
                "next_branch_stem" and "next_bridge"
            Finally, note that this simple analysis is incomplete (even if one
            were to ignore the possibility of deletion/pruning), because it
            relies on node degree only. For example, a node that is a stub in
            the graph skeleton and a binode in the partitioned skeleton could
            potentially serve as a bridge stem, given only that information.
            However, it could be that the edge in the graph skeleton for which
            that node is a stub also has a stub at the other end, which is
            absent in the partitioned skeleton. In that case, the node could
            never serve as a bridge stem (but it could potentially serve as a
            branch stem).
        [4] For this kind, graph must be False and partitioned must be True, or
            else an error is raised. The described nodes reflect the current
            categorization within the partitioned skeleton.
        [5] Loops are a special case of the scenario described in [3]. Namely,
            if graph is True, nodes from quarantined uninterrupted terminal
            loops are described for each loop whose stem node currently exists
            in the graph or partitioned skeletons, whereas if partitioned is
            instead True, nodes from uninterrupted terminal loops that were
            added to the partitioned skeleton are described (see
            .add_loops_to_partitioned()).
        [6] Exactly one of graph and partitioned must be specified as True, or
            an error is raised. If graph is True, the described nodes are the
            ends of every edge in the graph skeleton and therefore include all
            stubs and hubs, and may also include binodes, especially after
            partitioning out has begun. If partitioned is instead True, the
            described nodes are the ends of every path in the partitioned
            skeleton, which should be equivalent to all stubs and hubs and
            include no binodes.
        [7] Refers to nodes deleted during isolation of the graph skeleton.
            Because these nodes belong to neither the graph nor partitioned
            skeleton, both the graph and partitioned arguments must be specified
            as False.

        graph is a boolean that specifies whether nodes in the graph skeleton
        should be among those described.

        partitioned is a boolean that specifies whether nodes in the partitioned
        skeleton should be among those described.

        coords is a boolean that specifies whether coords_array should be
        generated. If coords is False, coords_array in the returned tuple is
        instead None.

        degrees is a boolean that specifies whether degrees_array should be
        generated. If degrees is True, an error is raised unless kind explicitly
        depends on node degrees (i.e., has a [1] next to its name further above)
        or line ends (i.e., has a [6] next to its name further above). If
        degrees is instead False, degrees_array in the returned tuple is None.

        loops is a boolean that specifies whether uninterrupted terminal loops
        should be included when node degree is calculated. This argument is
        ignored unless kind explicitly depends on a node degrees (i.e., has a
        [1] next to its name further above) or line ends (i.e., has a [6] next
        to its name further above).

        interpolate_3D is a boolean that specifies whether interpolated z-
        coordinates should be included in the returned coords_array as an
        additional column. These coordinates can only be interpolated if the
        input polygon was 3D. They are interpolated in three steps:
            1) z- (and x- and y-) coordinates are linearly interpolated between
               vertices of the input polygon at the spatial sampling interval
               specified at initialization.
            2) Voronoi vertices are computed by planar (2D) Voronoi analysis on
               the polygon boundary samples from the first step.
            3) The z-coordinate for each Voronoi vertex is then approximated by
               the mean of the z-coordinates of the three closest polygon
               boundary samples. Note that, due to the nature of Voronoi
               analysis, each of these three polygon boundary samples is
               equidistant from the Voronoi vertex.
        Note that the first two of these steps were already completed during
        initialization. If coords is False, interpolate_3D is ignored.

        Warning: The z-coordinates interpolated if interpolate_3D is True are
        approximate, and they may be especially crude (relative to reality) if
        the terrain across polygon's width is not approximately planar locally.
        Additionally, such interpolation is a relatively expensive operation,
        and the results are not saved, so each z-coordinate is re-interpolated
        whenever it is requested.

        Note: For kinds that explicitly depend on node degrees (i.e., have a [1]
        next to their names further above), an advanced functionality is
        supported. Namely, if both graph and partitioned are False, an attempt
        is made to describe nodes from the raw data that exist prior to
        isolation of the graph skeleton. These data exists only temporarily, and
        are automatically deleted either during or soon after initialization. If
        they no longer exist, an error is raised. Also note that retrieving
        these data has a significant per-call computational cost. Therefore, you
        might consider a single call with degrees specified as True rather than
        multiple calls.

        However, deleting lines, especially from the partitioned skeleton, can
        have unexpected consequences, including splitting the partitioned
        skeleton into two or more connected components. It is highly recommended
        that you consider .prune() instead for deleting paths from the
        partitioned skeleton.

        lines is a SkeletalLineString or sequence of SkeletalLineString's that
        specifies the edges and/or paths to be deleted. If any line is
        unrecognized (e.g., was already deleted), that line is simply ignored.
        However, if any object other than a SkeletalLineString is encountered,
        an error is raised.

        safe is a boolean that specifies whether it should be tested that each
        line in lines belongs to the current skeletal analysis. If safe is False

        skeletal analysis could be deleted in its place. safe is False is a bit
        faster.

        Estimate how many nodes can be safely processed in memory.

        There are two potential memory bottlenecks during processing. The first
        occurs during initialization, primarily due to Voronoi analysis, and
        scales directly with the number of boundary samples and hence inversely
        with the sampling interval. At that bottleneck, the smallest sampling
        inteval that can be accommodated within the targeted memory footprint
        (allowing no margin) bottleneck is given by
            .estimate_safe_interval(..., include_partitioning=False)[0]
        The second bottleneck occurs during partitioning-out and depends most
        directly on the number of nodes in the graph skeleton, excluding those
        binodes that have been contracted through. With both bottlenecks
        considered, the smallest interval that can be fully processed within the
        targeted memory footprint (with some margin) is given by
            .estimate_safe_interval(..., include_partitioning=True)[0]
        but requires a brute-force search because of the complex relationship
        between sampling interval and node count. Alternatively, the current
        function can be called after initialization to directly (and quickly)
        return the critical number of nodes that can be fully processed
        (allowing no margin). With this knowledge, it may be possible to
        simplify the skeleton by some means other than coarsening of the

                                          should (ever) be called; defaults to
                                          True
            .make_deep_test_func [func]   see the documentation attached to this
                                          function
        Note that .min defaults to 0 if no_negative_costs is True, which means
        that 0-cost paths are not strictly excluded. However, it is assumed
        throughout this module that no path that should be considered can have a
        cost less than that of the highest-cost self-referential path (e.g., the
        path from a node to itself that never leaves that node). In many cases,
        such as length, the cost of a self-referental path is 0 and therefore,
        in effect, .min in these cases defaults to a value just above 0 (i.e.,
        numpy.nextafter(0., 1.)).

        min_cost is a float that specifies the minimum cost permitted for a full
        path. If a full path has a cost smaller than min_cost, that path will
        not be walked at all (and therefore will not be truncated, either). If
        min_cost is None (the default), it will be interpreted as 0 if
        no_negative_costs is True, otherwise as negative infinity.

        max_cost is a float that specifies the maximum cost permitted for a full
        path. If a full path has a cost greater than max_cost, that path will
        not be walked at all (and therefore will not be truncated, either). If
        max_cost is None (the default), it will be interpreted as positive
        infinity.

        min_trunc_cost is a float that specifies the minimum cost permitted for
        a truncated path. If min_trunc_cost is not specified (None), no minimum
        cost criterion will be applied to truncated paths.

        max_trunc_cost is a float that specifies the maximum cost permitted for
        a truncated path. If max_trunc_cost is not specified (None), or it is no
        larger than max_cost (which would logically guarantee satisfaction of
        the max_trunc_cost criterion, if cost positively correlates with
        length), no maximum cost criterion will be applied to truncated paths.

        path_test_func is a function that is called once for each path (whether
        full or truncated) upon generation of a LineString to represent that
        path. It effectively provides an opportunity to make a "final" decision
        about how to proceed. Its call signature and expected return tuple are
        described further above. Note that, like all edges and paths in the
        current class, the LineString supports some special attributes (see
        .get_lines()). Note further that if path_test_func was created by an
        earlier call of the current function and has more restrictive criteria
        (e.g., min_cost, min_trunc_cost), these will be honored.

        ends_test_func is a function that is called once for each path (whether
        full or truncated) when both ends of the path have been identified. It
        effectively provides an opportunity to avoid the processing that would
        otherwise take place prior to the calling of path_test_func(). The
        function's call signature is
            ends_test_func(path_cost, bool, path_start_array, path_end_array)
        where path_cost is the traversal cost of the (possibly truncated) path,
        bool is a a boolean that indicates whether the path was truncated, and
        path_start_array and path_end_array are the coordinates of the first and
        last nodes in the path, respectively, as arrays. Z-coordinates are
        included if .polygon is 3D. The function must return a tuple of the form
        (accept, abort), as described further above.

        no_negative_costs is a boolean that specifies whether negative costs are
        possible. Its only use is to interpret min_cost and min_trunc_cost, as
        described further above.

        force_accuracy is a boolean that specifies whether the cumulative added
        cost returned by .partition_out*()'s must include the costs of any
        truncated (converging) paths. If force_accuracy is True, the process of
        partitioning out may not be quite as fast and may use significantly more
        memory.

        Note: min_cost and max_cost can potentially dramatically reduce analysis
        time if specified.

        Note: The filtering achieved by min_trunc_cost and max_trunc_cost can be
        moved to path_test_func() without compromising the final result. Whether
        it is "better" to use min/max_trunk_cost or path_test_func() depends on
        your particular use case, but in general, applying this filtering in
        path_test_func() will slow performance but could save memory relative to
        applying the same filtering via min/max_trunc_cost.

        Note: force_accuracy may be set to True (regardless of how it is
        specified) if this is implicity required by other arguments (e.g.,
        min_trunc_cost and max_trunc_cost). If this occurs, the returned test
        function's .retest_on_convergence will be True.

        Warning: It is very easy to go wrong if you try to create a test
        function from scratch (i.e., without calling the current method), and it
        is also completely unnecessary in most cases. At a bare minimum, it is
        strongly advised that you carefully view the current method's code
        before attempting to create a custom test function on your own.

            The returned function deep_test_func() simulates the role of
            test_func() within Skeleton.partition_out*()'s as much as possible
            and has a Type 3 call signature (see Skeleton.make_test_func()).
            Specifically, deep_test_func() first tests whether the traversal
            cost of the path passed to it satisfies the cost_func.min and
            cost_func.max bounds. Even though test_func() is not actually called
            to implement this test (neither within deep_test_func() nor within
            Skeleton.partition_out*()'s), we will refer to this test as a "Type
            0" call for simplicity hereinafter. Then, if the passed path is
            complete:
                test_func() calls of Types 1a, 2, and 4 are executed, in order.
            Otherwise, if the passed path is truncated:
                test_func() calls of Types 2, 1b, and 4 are executed, in order.
            The only notable departure of this simulation from what is
            implemented in Skeleton.partition_out*()'s is that if a truncated
            path is passed, a Type 1a call is never executed, because the
            corresponding full (non-truncated) path traversal cost is unknown.
            Equivalent to the implementation in Skeleton.partition_out*()'s, as
            soon as a call indicates that a path should be rejected or that an
            abort should be triggered, the sequences of calls enumerated above
            is exited. In all cases, the result of the final test_func() call is
            returned, where the failure of a Type 0 "call" returns (False,
            False). A major use for deep_test_func() is as the value for the
            *test_func arguments in Skeleton.sweep()

        Make a cost function and related priority and orientation functions.

        The current function creates and returns a cost function, with
        attributes:
            cost_func(line, flipped=False)
                Calculate the cost of traversing line. If directed is True,
                specifying flipped=True instead calculates the cost of
                traversing the line in the direction opposite to its current
                orientation.
            cost_func.get_cost(line)
                Same as hint, if hint is a function, or a function that returns
                the attribute specified by hint.
            cost_func.is_directed
                Same as the directed argument.
            cost_func.avoid_nan
                Same as the avoid_nan argument.
            cost_func.infinite
                Same as the infinite argument.
            cost_func.negative
                Same as the negative argument.
            cost_func.priority_func(line)
                Get the minimum cost of traversing line in either direction, if
                directed is True. Otherwise identical to cost_func.get_cost().
            if directed:
                cost_func.get_flipped_cost(line)
                    Same as get_flipped_cost argument, if it is specified,
                    otherwise equivalent to cost_func(line, True).
                cost_func.orient_func(line)
                    Return line oriented in-place such that its traversal cost
                    is minimized.

        hint is a function or string that specifies how a line's traversal cost
        should be calculated. If hint is a function, it must accept a LineString
        as its first or only argument and return the traversal cost of that
        line, which must be coercible to a float (including nan, inf, and -inf,
        but excluding None, for example). If that cost depends on direction, the
        cost corresponding to the LineString's current orientation should be
        returned. If hint is instead a string, it is interpreted to be an
        attribute of the LineString and replaced with a function that
        efficiently fetches that attribute (using operator.attrgetter()). For
        example, the following will return a cost function based on the lengths
        of a LineString:
            make_cost_func(".length")
            make_cost_func(".length", avoid_nan=None)  # Faster.
        "Sub-attributes" may also be specified (though the particular example
        below is probably useless):
            make_cost_func(".skeleton.polygon")

        directed is a boolean that specifies whether traversal costs should be
        treated as dependent on direction. If directed is False (the default),
        the returned cost function may be much more efficient than if directed
        were specified as True. For an example in which direction matters,
        consider .delta_z (see .get_lines()).

        get_flipped_cost is a function that specifies how a line's traversal
        cost in the direction opposite its current orientation should be
        calculated. It has the same call signature as hint and the same
        expectations for the returned value. As an example, consider the
        following:
            make_cost_func(".delta_z", True, lambda line: -line.delta_z)
        If directed is True and get_flipped_cost is not specified (None), a
        suitable function based on hint() is automatically generated.
        Nonetheless, specifying your own function can be much more efficient.
        If directed is instead False, this argument is ignored.

        infinite is a boolean that specifies whether infinite traversal costs
        should be supported. If infinite is False and an infinite cost is
        calculated, behavior may not be as expected.

        negative is a boolean that specifies whether negative costs should be
        supported. If negative is False and a negative cost is calculated,
        behavior may not be as expected.

        avoid_nan is a boolean that specifies how costs that evaluate to nan
        should be handled by cost_func.orient_func(). If cost_func.get_cost()
        and cost_func.get_flipped_cost() will never return nan, you should
        specify avoid_nan as None for some performance benefit. If avoid_nan is
        True (the default), cost_func.orient_func() will return nan only if the
        traversal cost in both directions is nan. If avoid_nan is instead False,
        cost_func.orient_func() will return nan if the traversal cost in either
        direction is nan.

        Note: You can use a cost function to force traversal to follow a
        particular direction by returning a special value to disallow the
        undesired direction. For maximum efficiency, nan is recommended, but
        positive infinity (i.e., float("inf")) works as well if the infinite
        argument is specified as True in the current function. For example, if
        you only want paths to go downslope and follow the steepest gradient,
        you could specify the following for hint:
            def hint(line, nan=float("nan")):
                if line.delta_z > 0:
                    return nan  # Disallow upslope direction.
                return line.length  # Route by shortest (2D) path.
        Note that returning line.length would result in the shortest 2D paths
        (i.e., in the xy plane) being preferred, and the shortest 2D path
        between any two points on a 3D surface implies the maximum gradient.
        cost_func.orient_func() leverages the just described special value
        behavior to determine an acceptable orientation for a line. The line
        will be flipped in place up to one time to achieve a traversal cost that
        is not specially valued, and then returned with the corresponding
        orientation. If both orientations have specially-valued traversal costs,
        the line is oriented arbitrarily. Note that you may be able to create a
        more efficient orientation function depending on your use case,
        especially if you did not specify get_flipped_cost or you can devise a
        faster orientation test than fully calculating the traversal cost.

        Warning: It is strongly suggested that neither hint() nor
        get_flipped_cost() return negative traversal costs. Although negative
        costs are, strictly, nominally supported, they are usually unwise. If
        .polygon has one or more holes, negative costs raise the possibility
        that negative cycles will occur, in which a path winds around a hole ad
        infinitum to minimize its cumulative traversal cost, i.e., make it ever
        more negative. If this happens, analysis will not get stuck in that
        infinite loop, but partitioning will fail. On the other hand, if
        .polygon does not have holes, routing by negative values usually yields
        results that are either undesirable or identical to what could be
        achieved using traversal costs >= 0, and is less computationally
        efficient in the latter case.

        support nonzero target values (recursion) and facilitate the
        disjoint_kind argument.

        node_kind2 is a string that specifies the kind of node that must be
        found at the other end of each full path. .get_nodes(node_kind2) must
        desribe these nodes.

        disjoint_kind is a string that specifies the kind of edge whose nodes
        are forbidden for any path to touch. If opportunistic is True, this
        disjoint relationship is only guaranteed for complete (non-truncated)
        paths.

        The remaining arguments are passed directly from .partition_out*()'s and
        are documented in those methods.

        """
        Partition out a main path (or paths) from the graph skeleton.

        The current method must be called first among .partition_out*()'s, as
        it partitions out (what is meant to be) the main trunk (or trunks) of
        the skeleton. Each path partitioned out by the current method must have
        each of its ends at a node that is both a stub in the graph
        skeleton and not yet present in the partitioned skeleton. Like all
        .partition_out*()'s, the current method:
            1) Identifies paths of consecutively linked edges in the graph
               skeleton between suitable nodes. Each path is the lowest-cost
               (e.g., shortest) path between the two nodes at either end, and
               the first path identified is the highest-cost (e.g., longest) of
               all such paths. Therefore, the first path effectively links the
               two suitable nodes that are most widely separated in terms of
               path cost (e.g., length), under the requirement that all paths
               must be optimized for cost.
            2) Removes the component edges of accepted paths from the graph
               skeleton.
            3) Merges each path's components edges together.
            4) Adds each path to the partitioned skeleton.
            5) Returns a tuple of the form (added_path_count, cumulative_cost,
               includes_truncated, considered_path_count, deleted_path_count),
               where:
            added_path_count:      Total number of paths partitioned out
                                   (including each truncated part, if any).
            cumulative_cost:       Total cost of all paths (including at least
                                   those full paths that were not truncated).
            includes_truncated:    Boolean (True/False) indicating whether
                                   cumulative_cost includes the cost of any
                                   truncated parts that were partitioned out.
            considered_path_count: Total number of full paths that were
                                   considered. If search was aborted, this count
                                   includes the path that was being considered
                                   when the abort was triggered.
            deleted_path_count:    Total number of paths (including each
                                   truncated part, if any) deleted from the
                                   graph skeleton.

        target is an integer that specifies the minimum number of paths that
        should be partitioned out, if possible. In effect, the current method is
        called repeatedly (with target=0), with each call corresponding to a
        single pass (see opportunistic argument), until either target is
        satisfied (but possibly exceeded) or a call partitions out no paths. If
        target is None, it is interpreted as infinity. See note further below
        for method-specific consequences.

        cost_func is a funcion that specifies how the cost of each edge in the
        graph skeleton is determined. See .make_cost_func(). If cost_func is not
        specified (None), it defaults to EasySkeleton.length2D_cost_func.

        test_func is a function that is called to determine whether a particular
        path should be accepted and whether path-processing should continue. It
        will only be called for paths that are "considered" (see opportunistic
        argument). See .make_test_func() for more details.

        from_nodes is a sequence of the the nodes (represented by their Voronoi
        vertex indices) that are accetable to the user as path start nodes.
        These will be subset, as necessary, to ensure that they meet the base
        criteria for start and/or end nodes within the current method (see
        further above). Use .get_nodes() to explore the available node options.

        to_nodes is a sequence of the the nodes (represented by their Voronoi
        vertex indices) that are accetable to the user as path end (final)
        nodes. These will be subset, as necessary, to ensure that they meet the
        base criteria for start and/or end nodes within the current method (see
        further above). Use .get_nodes() to explore the available node options.

        opportunistic is a boolean that specifies some details of the behavior
        of path processing. At the start of each pass (see target argument), the
        graph skeleton is solved in a graph traversal sense such that the least-
        cost path between every pair of nodes is computed. Then, each of these
        paths is considered in order of decreasing cost. Note that, if more than
        one path is partitioned out in a single pass, it is possible for a path
        under consideration to converge with a path partitioned out earlier on
        the same pass. With this background in mind, the behavior of path
        processing depends on the value of opportunistic in the following ways:
            True:    Any convergent path is truncated at the point of
                     convergence and treated like any other path. The path is
                     then walked from the opposite end, if the terminal edge at
                     that end has not yet been partitioned out, and truncated a
                     second time where convergence occurs on that walk.
                     Therefore, up to two truncated parts are partitioned out as
                     paths for each full path that is considered.
            False    Upon encountering the first convergent path on a given
                     pass, that pass is terminated.
            None     Exactly one path is partitioned out per pass. Unless
                     test_func is specified, this is guaranteed to be the
                     highest-cost of all optimized paths.
        The options are listed in order of decreasing opportunism. The less
        opportunistic that processing is, the more likely that the path(s)
        partitioned out will have a consistent logic, potentially enhancing the
        consistency of any later pruning. However, because each call of the
        current method incurs significant overhead, lower opportunism usually
        implies lower computational efficiency. See note further below for
        method-specific consequences.

        disjoint is a boolean that specifies whether each successive trunk must
        be disjoint from all other trunks. If disjoint is True, opportunistic
        must not be True or an error is raised.

        Note: For the current method, opportunistic and target have the
        following practical consequences, where "exhaustive" indicates that no
        more paths of the indicated kind could be partitioned out on any future
        call:

                                         both trunks and branches are exhausted.

        Prune (remove and return) paths from the partitioned skeleton.

        Unless a filter is applied at some point, you'll likely end up with more
        paths in the partitioned skeleton than you want. You can apply a filter
        at any of the following points:
            1) After initialization, by deleting edges from the graph skeleton
               using .delete_lines().
            2) After any partitioning out, by deleting paths from the
               partitioned skeleton using the current function or (less
               preferred) .delete_lines().
            3) After writing out the partitioned skeleton, manually.
        The most common unwanted paths are branches that stem from a
        "legitimate" (wanted) trunk, branch, or bridge and head directly to the
        nearest boundary, effectively spanning half the local width. For
        brevity, we refer to these as "spurious branches." One of the major
        innovations of the current algorithm is the identification of the
        "normalized length" as a useful metric for estimating the relative
        importance of a branch. The normalized length simply scales a branch's
        length by half the approximate local width at its stem:
            2. * branch.length / branch.stem_width
        For spurious branches, the normalized length is typically very near 1.
        For branches of progressively greater importance, the normalized length
        is typically progressively larger, but note that normalized length is
        more reliable at finer sampling intervals. A major advantage of
        normalized length over length itself is its scaling to local geometry.
        For example, if the input polygon is the outline of a river, a 100 m
        tributary joining a stream that is locally 10 m wide would have the same
        normalized length as a 1 km tributary joining a stream that is locally
        100 m wide, even though its length is only one-tenth as great. The
        current function returns a list of lines that were pruned (but see
        gobble).

        cutoff is a float that specifies the critical cost (e.g., normalized
        length) for pruning. If a path has a cost (as calculated by get_cost())
        equal to or greater than cutoff, it is guaranteed not be pruned.
        (However, paths may be gobbled regardless of their cost (see gobble) and
        paths with costs smaller than cutoff may not be pruned if target is
        specified (not None).) For help choosing a normalied length cutoff, see
        note further below.

        get_cost is a function that is called to assign a cost to each path. See
        documentation for .make_cost_func(). If get_cost is not specified
        (None), its default depends on kind:
            kind           Default get_cost
            "branch"       EasySkeleton.get_normalized_length
            [otherwise]    EasySkeleton.length2D_cost_func.get_cost

        target is an integer that specifies a limit for the number of paths to
        be pruned. It is interpreted as follows:
            target < 0:  the negative of the maximum number of paths to be
                         pruned (i.e., the most extreme allowed change in path
                         count)
            target > 0:  the maximum number of paths of the specified kind that
                         should remain after pruning
            target == 0: disallowed (raises TypeError)
        If target is unspecified (None), no limit is applied.

        priority_func is a function that determines the order in which paths are
        pruned. It is called with a path (LineString) an its only argument and
        must return a sortable result. Therefore, any function that can be
        specified for path_list.sort()'s key argument, where path_list is a list
        of paths (LineString's), is suitable for priority_func. Paths for which
        the smallest values are returned by priority_func() will be pruned
        first. If target is not specified (None), priority_func is irrelevant
        and therefore ignored. If target is specified but priority_func is not
        specified (None), the default for priority_func depends on kind:
            kind           Default priority_func
            "branch"       EasySkeleton.get_normalized_length
            [otherwise]    EasySkeleton.length2D_cost_func.get_cost

        gobble is a boolean that specifies whether
            .gobble_paths(stub_indices, True, True)
        should be called immediately after pruning, where stub_indices is
        generated by
            .get_nodes("stub", False, True, coords=False)[0]
        immediately before pruning (but see special case below). Therefore, any 
        nodes that are newly stubs due to pruning will be gobbled. This 
        prevents some otherwise commonly encountered but usually undesired 
        consequences of pruning, such as branches that are no longer connected 
        to the rest of the partitioned skeleton at either end and bridges that 
        become disconnected from the partitioned skeleton at one or both ends. 
        If gobble is True, a tuple is returned of the form
            (pruned_paths, gobbled_paths)
        where each item is a list of paths (LineString's) that were directly
        pruned or later gobbled, respectively. Note that gobbled_paths may
        include paths whose kind is not the specified kind. In the special
        case that there are no stub indices prior to pruning (so that the
        .get_nodes() call above returns None), gobbled_paths is an empty list.

        kind is a string that specifies the kind of partitioned-out path to be
        pruned. In the special case that kind is "trunk" and the call would
        prune all trunks, an error is raised and no pruning is executed.

        Warning: cutoff can be specified as None (the default), but in that
        case, every path of the specified kind is considered a candidate for
        pruning! This may be useful if target is also specified, but otherwise,
        cutoff=None should be used with care.

        Note: If cost_func is EasySkeleton.get_normalized_length, choosing a
        cutoff that suits your application can be a bit tricky. Commonly, a
        value between 1.1 and 5 is useful, but even if your ideal value lies
        within that interval (which is not guaranteed), there remains a lot of
        variability in behavior across that range. Here are a few strategies
        that you might consider:
            1) Write out the partitioned skeleton without pruning, being sure to
               include the normalized length of branches in the output. Then
               inspect the output in your preferred GIS program and manually
               determine what cutoff works well for you. You can then either
               manually prune the output or run the same code again with that
               cutoff specified.
            2) Output multiple partitioned skeletons at successively higher
               cutoff's and then retain the output that works best. It's
               important to note that you need not create a new Skeleton for
               each of these outputs, so the processing time should be small as
               it only represents the pruning itself. However, for large
               skeletons, the write-out times may still be significant.
            3) Reason what the cutoff should be for your application, given how
               the normalized length is calculated. For example, do you want to
               retain branches that are 10% longer than half the local width of
               the input polygon? If so, set cutoff to 1.1. If those branches
               sounds unimportant to you, do you instead want to retain branches
               that are twice as long as half the local width? Then set cutoff
               to 2.0. However, bear in mind that the normalized length only
               approximates the local width (see documentation for
               SkeletalLineString2D.segment_widths) and is calculated with
               better precision at finer sampling intervals. For these reasons,
               a cutoff slightly less than your reasoned ideal value may be
               preferable.

        """
        Sweep isolated edges from the graph skeleton.

        After any partitioning-out, the graph skeleton may have "isolated" edges
        (see .describe_line()). For each such isolated edge, the only path that
        can include it is the path that is identical to the edge itself.
        Therefore, the path-finding that underlies .partition_out*()'s (though
        effective) is needlessly inefficient. The current function identifies
        all isolated edges and (by default) partitions them out from the graph
        skeleton if they pass the corresponding test, automatically categorizing
        them as branches or bridges. This can substantially improve performance
        without any deviation in the final results. A tuple of the form
            (swept_count, deleted_edges)
        is returned where swept_count is an integer that gives the number of
        edges swept to the partitioned skeleton and deleted_edges is a list of
        any edges that were deleted.

        branch_test_func is a function that specifies a test function to be
        applied only to those isolated edges that would be partitioned out as
        branches.

        bridge_test_func is a function that specifies a test function to be
        applied only to those isolated edges that would be partitioned out as
        bridgees.

        orient_func is a function that is passed an edge (LineString) as its
        first and only argument and must return either 1) that edge oriented in
        the desired direction or 2) None, to indicate that the edge should not
        be partitioned out. For consistency, the edge should be so oriented as
        to minimize its traversal cost from start to end, as this would have
        occurred if it had instead been partitioned out by a .partition_out*().
        (See the orient_func attribute of the function returned by
        .make_cost_func().) If orient_func is not specified (None), edges are
        partitioned out with arbitrary directionality.

        delete_others is a boolean that specifies whether isolated edges that
        are neither branch- nor bridge-like should be deleted. Such edges are
        "irreparably isolated", that is, they are isolated in the graph skeleton
        and would also be isolated in the partitioned skeleton if they were
        partitioned out. Note that irreparably isolated edges only exist if
        .delete_lines() was called.

        Note: branch_test_func and bridge_test_func serve the same role as
        test_func in .partition_out_branches/bridges() except that 1) only a
        Type 3 call is executed (see .make_test_func() and the
        .make_deep_test_func() of the function returned by that method) and 2)
        the abort value returned by *_test_func() is ignored, because
        isolated  edges are iterated over in arbitrary order. If the relevant
        *test_func is not specified (None), the edge is considered acceptable.

        """
        Initiate skeleton derivation for a polygon. (Compare Skeleton.)

        In simplest terms, the skeleton of a polygon collapses an elongate
        polygon to a linear form. For example, the outline of a river is a
        polygon (with a nonzero area). However, we often think of a river in
        terms of its skeleton, such as when a river is drawn as a line on a map.
        Even though that line does not represent the river's width, it still
        captures a useful expression of the river's geometry. In the algorithm
        used by the current type, the skeleton is composed of paths of three
        different kinds. Approximately, these are the main path, called the
        "trunk"; paths that reach from any other path to the boundary of
        polygon, called "branches"; and paths that link from one path to
        another, called "bridges". You are strongly encouraged to take a look at
        the documentation for Skeleton.__init__() for a somewhat fuller
        description than is included here, as well as read the following paper
        for an even more detailed, albeit technical, description of this
        algorithm, including some very helpful figures:
            Schaefer, E. I., & Pelletier, J.D. (in review). An algorithm to 
            reduce a river network or other graph-like polygon to a set of 
            lines. Computers & Geosciences.

        polygon is a Polygon for which skeleton derivation will be executed.

        interval is a float that specifies a sampling interval, which is
        analogous to the desired resolution of the skeleton. Ideally, interval
        should be no coarser than half the width of polygon's narrowest
        constriction (see "CUT" isolation_mode option), but finer intervals
        require larger memory footprints. See also template_interval for
        supported special values.

        min_normalized_length is a float that specifies the minimum normalized
        length permitted for a branch. Any branch with a lower value will be
        pruned by .prune(min_normalized_length). The normalized length is
        intended to approximately score the importance of a branch and starts at
        ~1. Practically, it approximates the ratio between the length of a
        branch and half the local width of polygon at the branch's stem. Specify
        0 to disable. See .prune() for additional guidance.

        max_branch_count is an integer that specifies the maximum number of
        branches that can be retained. If more branches are initially
        identified, they are subset by .prune(target=max_branch_count).

        max_trunk_count is an integer that specifies the maximum number of
        trunks that can be identified. In many cases, max_trunk_count is best
        set to 1 (the default). However, consider the two following scenarios:
            Scenario 1: polygon represents a divided highway with occasional
                        links betwen these two parallel roads.
            Scenario 2: polygon represents a braided river whose shape
                        approximates the shape of the polygon in Scenario 1.
        Even though polygon is similar in each scenario, you probably want to
        define two trunks in Scenario 1 and one trunk in Scenario 2.

        mode is a string that specifies how the skeleton is subdivided (and,
        more importantly, "partitioned out"). Depending on which two modes you
        are comparing and the geometry of polygon, the skeletons produced by two
        different modes may differ not at all, by very little, or dramatically.
        In addition, the range of speeds implied by the range of modes can be
        extremely large. The supported modes, with descriptions of typical (but
        not necessarily guaranteed) behavior, are:
            "PREFER_BRIDGE" *
                Paths within the skeleton will be preferentially categorized as
                bridges, resulting in a longer total length for that category.
                Moderately fast.
            "MAX_BRIDGE"
                Paths within the skeleton will be preferentially categorized as
                bridges, resulting in a longer total length for that category,
                and the lengths of the longest bridges will be maximized.
                Slow.
            "MAX_BRIDGE_MAX_BRANCH"
                Paths within the skeleton will be preferentially categorized as
                bridges, resulting in a longer total length for that category,
                and the lengths of the longest bridges, then the longest
                branches, will be approximately maximized. Slow to very slow.
            "PREFER_BRANCH"
                Paths within the skeleton will be preferentially categorized as
                branches, resulting in a longer total length for that category.
                Fast.
            "MAX_BRANCH"
                Paths within the skeleton will be very preferentially
                categorized as branches, resulting in a longer total length for
                that category, and the lengths of the longest branches will be
                maximized. Slow.
            "MAX_BRANCH_MAX_BRIDGE"
                Paths within the skeleton will be preferentially categorized as
                branches, resulting in a longer total length for that category,
                and the lengths of the longest branches, then the longest
                bridges, will be approximately maximized. Slow to very slow.
        where all lengths are measured in the x-y plane.
        *This mode is the default and will typically yield categorizations that
        most closely align with intuition. Consequently, branches will be
        defined in a way that may feel more logical, making normalized length a
        more useful criterion.

        trunk_mode is a string that specifies how the trunk is identified. For
        each supported option, the trunk(s) are defined as the first and (if
        max_trunk_count > 1) each subsequent possible, non-overlapping,
        length-optimized path that...
            "DEFAULT"
                ...has the longest 2D length.
            "EUCLIDEAN" [1]
                ...has the greatest straight-line end-to-end span in 2D.
            "EUCLIDEAN3D" [1] [3]
                ...has the greatest straight-line end-to-end span in 3D.
            "MIN_EUCLIDEAN_#" [2]
                ...has at least the specified straight-line end-to-end span in
                2D in map units (e.g., "MIN_EUCLIDEAN_123.45").
            "MIN_EUCLIDEAN3D_#" [2]
                ...has at least the specified straight-line end-to-end span in
                3D in map units (e.g., "MIN_EUCLIDEAN3D_123.45").
            "NEAR_#_#" [1]
                ...has the longest 2D length of those paths with one end as near
                to the specified coordinates as possible (e.g.,
                "NEAR_123.45_678.90").
            "NEAR_#_#_AND_#_#" [1]
                ...has each end as near to the specified coordinates as possible
                (e.g., "NEAR_123.45_678.90_AND_678.90_123.45").
            "HIGH_LOW" [1] [3]
                ...has each end at either the z-coordinate minimum or maximum
                (among all stub nodes).
            "MIN_RELIEF_#"[2] [3]
                ...has at least the specified end-to-end change in z-coordinate,
                where the change is unsigned (e.g., "MIN_RELIEF_123.45").
            "MIN_RELIEF_#%" [2] [3]
                ...has at least the specified end-to-end change in z-coordinate,
                where that change is specified as a percentage of the maximum z-
                coordinate difference between any two vertices of the input
                polygon (e.g., "MIN_RELIEF_90.5%").
            "MIN_MEAN_WIDTH_#" [2]
                ...has at least the specified mean width, approximated by
                path.area / path.length2D.
        As a special case, the following trunk_mode is also supported:
            "NONE"
                Processing terminates after isolation of the graph skeleton.
        [1] If max_trunk_count is greater than one, an error is raised.
        [2] This option is at least partially implemented as a brute-force
            search in which paths are considered in the same order as "DEFAULT".
            Therefore, it can be very slow.
        [3] polygon must be 3D. Additionally, this option can be very slow due
            to the required interpolation of z-coordinates.

        isolation_mode is a string that specifies several aspects of how the
        graph skeleton is isolated from its complement and general memory
        safeguards. It is therefore considered advanced functionality and should
        not be changed from its default value without understanding the
        consequences. It is documented with other arguments to
        Skeleton.__init__(), except for one additional option supported by the
        current class:
            "CUT2"
                *EXPERIMENTAL AND MAY BE DEPRECATED IN A FUTURE RELEASE*
                If cutting is used and templating is enabled, Voronoi vertices 
                that were provisionally interpreted to belong to the skeleton 
                but were excluded by cutting will be added back to the template 
                if they lie within the test (input or proxy) polygon. Implies 
                "CUT". The inclusion of these "suspicious" nodes can help to
                avoid truncation by cutting at input polygon necks (locally 
                narrower than twice the template interval). *However*, this is
                effectively a (limited-scope) brute-force kludge that could
                potentially exhaust your available memory, as these suspicious
                nodes are not counted when optimizing an implicit template
                interval. In practice, this functionality is therefore
                most useful when the goal is to more fully capture tapering
                ends of the input polygon rather than to recover extensive
                swaths of that polygon that are narrower than twice the
                template interval and/or ringed by necks.

        tails is a boolean that specifies whether a segment ("tail") should be
        added to each trunk end and each outward-facing branch end to extend
        them to the boundary of polygon. More precisely, if tails is True, tails
        are added prior to implementation of the min_normalized_length and
        max_branch_count arguments and generally helps to align the behavior of
        these arguments to expectations, at some cost to processing time.
        Alternatively, tails can be added after skeleton generation by
        .add_tails().

        shortest_branch is a float that specifies the shortest 2D length
        permitted for a branch.

        shortest_bridge is a float that specifies the shortest 2D length
        permitted for a bridge.

        shortest_loop is a float that specifies the shortest 2D length permitted
        for an uninterrupted terminal loop (i.e., a loop at either end of a
        trunk or at the outward-facing end of a branch).

        cost_func is a function that specifies how the cost (usually length) of
        each candidate trunk, branch, or bridge is calculated, and therefore how
        it is routed (because routing always minimizes cost) and the order in
        which each candidate is considered (because paths are considered in
        order of decreasing cost). If cost_func is not specified (None), each
        path's 2D length is used, or equivalently, cost_func defaults to
        .length2D_cost_func. Alternatively, cost_func can be specified as
        .length3D_cost_func to use each path's 3D length, but this may be much
        slower.

        template_interval is a float that specifies the interval used to
        generate the internally-used template skeleton. Because interval is
        analogous to resolution, a finer interval is generally desirable but has
        an exponentially greater memory footprint. To *simulate* accommodation
        of a much finer interval than could otherwise be accommodated within
        available memory, a template skeleton can be generated first, at the
        coarser template_interval. Raw data can then be generated at the (finer)
        specified interval but subset based on the geometry of the template
        skeleton. The result is a skeleton that has local positional and
        directional accuracies identical to those of a skeleton fully processed
        at the specified interval but no more (topologically) complete than the
        template skeleton. The exact effects of this simulation depend on
        details of polygon's geometry but could result, for example, in the
        selection of less-than-ideal branches or even the loss of (usually less
        important) portions of the skeleton. Some special values are supported
        for both interval and template_interval:
        interval    template_interval    1st Attempt    2nd Attempt*
        >0          None                 [i1, t0]
        >0          >0                   [i1, t0]       [i1, t1]
        >0          0                    [i1, t0]       [i1, t2]
        >0          -0.                  [i1, t2]**
        >0          <0                   [i1, t1]**
        0           None                 [i2, t0]
        0           0                    [i3, t2]
        0           >0                   [i3, t1]
        0           -0.                  [i3, t2]**
        0           <0                   [i3, t1]**
         * Occurs if and when memory becomes exhausted, or if and when the first
           attempt is aborted because such exhaustion is predicted.
        ** If template_interval is not None, every stub in the (coarse) template
           skeleton will have a mate (at least, initially) in the hybrid
           skeleton. If template_interval is (more specifically) negative, 
           that template skeleton will be an unpruned graph skeleton. Otherwise, 
           the template skeleton will be a partitioned skeleton that may be 
           pruned in order of increasing normalized length if such pruning is 
           necessary to confidently avoid exhaustion of targ_GB. Therefore, a
           negative template_interval ensures (reproducible) skeletonization 
           that does not depend on targ_GB but may pose memory hazards that 
           could be alleviated by discarding potentially unimportant branches 
           from the template skeleton.

             self.estimate_safe_interval(..., include_partitioning=False).
        [t0] No template skeleton is generated.
        [t1] A (sampling) interval of abs(template_interval) is used to generate
             a template skeleton.
        [t2] A (sampling) interval of self.estimate_safe_interval(...,
             include_partitioning=True)[0] is used to generate a template
             skeleton.
        If any special implicit (zero) values are used for interval or
        template_interval, you are strongly encouraged to read the corresponding
        note in the documentation of Skeleton.__init__().

        memory_option is an integer that specifies how the memory footprint is
        managed by the algorithm. The available options are:
            0   No special attempt is made to reduce the memory footprint.
            1   Some special attempts are made to reduce the memory footprint,
                but both the memory footprint and performance are typically only
                mildly impacted.
        More options may be added in the future.

        targ_GB is a float that specifies the target memory footprint, in
        gigabytes. targ_GB is unused unless the "SAFE" isolation_mode option or
        an implicit (zero) interval is specified. In those cases, if targ_GB is
        None, it is reset to 80% of the available physical memory as reported by
        the system, if possible, or an error is raised.

        Any additional keyword arguments are passed to Voronoi2D.__init__() when
        it is called internally.

        Note: If you are unable to generate a skeleton at the desired interval
        because processing is too slow and/or you run out of memory, consider
        any combination of the following options:
            1) smooth polygon's boundary
            2) remove unimportant (small?) holes in polygon
            3) specify template_interval
            4) specify memory_option > 0
            5) review documentation on the relative performance of your chosen
               mode and trunk_mode options

        """
        Construct a symmetric binary (fractal) tree.

        The tree is stored as a list of LineSegment2D's to .segments. Each
        segment has a .generation that gives the branch generation, or 0 for the
        trunk.

        trunk_length is a float that specifies the length of the tree's trunk,
        which is oriented upward and vertical (i.e., in a +y direction).

        length_factor is a float that specifies the ratio of the length of a
        given branch to that of its child branch, or equivalently, of the trunk
        to that of the first branches.

        angle is a float that specifies the angle (in degrees) of deflection of
        each child branch relative to the direction of the parent branch.

        generations is an integer that specifies the number of branch
        generations to create.

        trunk_base_coords is a sequence of length 2 that specifies the (x, y)
        coordinates of the trunk at its base.

        Warning: Specifying progressively higher generations requires
        exponentially more processing time, due to the fractal nature of the
        output.

        Note: To choose a length_factor that produces a tree that just barely
        contacts itself after infinite generations, you can use the following
        code at www.wolframalpha.com, being sure to specify the variable a
        (right end of code) with the desired angle:
            For 30 <= angle < 45:
                solve r*sin(-a) + (r^3)*sin(a) + ((r^4)/(1-(r^2)))*sin(2a) +
                    ((r^5)/(1-(r^2)))*sin(3a) = 0 for a=radians(30 degrees)
            For 45 <= angle < 90:
                solve r*sin(-a) + ((r^3)/(1-(r^2)))*sin(a) +
                    ((r^4)/(1-(r^2)))*sin(2a) = 0 for a=radians(45 degrees)
            For 90:
                r = 2^(-1/2)
            For 90 < angle <= 135:
                solve r*sin(-a) + ((r^2)/(1-(r^2)))*sin(-2a) +
                    ((r^3)/(1-(r^2)))*sin(-3a) = 0 for a=radians(91 degrees)
            For 135 < angle < 180:
                solve (r/(1-(r^2)))*sin(-a) + ((r^2)/(1-(r^2))) = 0 for
                    a=radians(91 degrees)
